# The will hopefully win a playoff game in 2024
Hopefully the steelers will make the necessary adjustments to win a playoff game this year.

In order for the steelers to win a playoff game this year we need to first hire a good offensive
coordinator. Kenny Picket needs to impprove, we need to draft good players and get good free 
agent players. Our defense needs to improve, especially the seconadary.
